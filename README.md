# ExLlama

A rewrite of the HF transformers implementation of Llama with the following goals, among others:

* Designed for use with quantized weights
* Fast and memory-efficient inference (not just attention)
* Mapping across multiple devices
* Built-in (multi) LoRA support
* Companion library of funky sampling functions

Disclaimer: This is currently a preview of a work in progress. Or maybe a proof of concept. Either way any part of it
is subject to change.

## Hardware/software requirements

I am developing on an RTX 4090 and an RTX 3070-Ti. Both cards support the CUDA kernel, but there might be
incompatibilities with older cards. I have no way of testing that right now.

I have no idea if this works on Windows/WSL, but feel free to try and contribute/give feedback.

## Dependencies

This list might be incomplete:

* `torch` tested on 2.1.0 (nightly) with cu118, might work with older CUDA versions also
* `safetensors` 0.3.1
* `sentencepiece`
* `ninja`

## Limitations

As of currently (working on it):

- No support for v1 models without groupsize
- I've encountered models with nonstandard layouts and datatypes (e.g. float32 embedding table). It'll take a while
to make sure all the possible permutations are supported.

## How to

There is no installer or package at the moment, but try this:

    pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cu118
    
    pip install safetensors sentencepiece ninja

    git clone https://github.com/turboderp/exllama
    cd exllama

    python test_benchmark_inference.py -t <path_to_tokenizer.model> -c <path_to_config.json> \ 
      -m <path_to_model.safetensors> -p -ppl

Alternatively, just specify a directory containing `tokenizer.model`, `config.json` and a single `.safetensors` file: 

    python test_benchmark_inference.py -d <path_to_model_files> -p -ppl

The CUDA extension is loaded at runtime so there's no need to install it separately. It will be compiled on the first
run and cached to `~/.cache/torch_extensions/` which could take a little while. If nothing happens at first, give it
a minute to compile.

Chatbot examples:

    python test_chatbot.py -d <path_to_model_files> -un "Jeff" -p prompt_chatbort.txt

    python test_chatbot.py -d <path_to_model_files> -un "Maxine" -p prompt_assistant.txt -nnl \
      -temp 1.00 -topp 0.95 -beams 5 -beamlen 20

<sup>1</sup> Can not achieve full sequence length without OoM (yet)  
<sup>2</sup> Not quite sure if this is act-order or not. Weights have no group index, at least   

All tests done on stock RTX 4090 / 12900K, running with a desktop environment, with a few other apps also using VRAM.

**"Prompt"** speed is inference over the sequence length listed minus 128 tokens. **"Worst"** is the average speed for
the last 128 tokens of the full context (worst case) and **"Best"** lists the speed for the first 128 tokens in an
empty sequence (best case.)

VRAM usage is as reported by PyTorch and does not include PyTorch's own overhead (CUDA kernels,
internal buffers etc.) This is somewhat unpredictable anyway. Best bet is to just optimize VRAM usage by the model,
probably aiming for 20 GB on a 24 GB GPU to ensure there is room for a desktop environment and all of Torch's
internals.

Perplexity is measured only to verify that the models are working. The dataset used is a particular, small sample from
WikiText, so scores are not necessarily comparable to other Llama benchmarks.

### Testing long sequences
The following tests were all done on **30B/65B, 4bit 128g** with various settings, just to test the max sequence length
and get a sense of what can be achieved with different or multiple GPUs right now. Llama goes incoherent generating 
past 2048 tokens anyway, but with some fine-tuning, who knows?

## Todo

Moved the todo list [here](TODO.md).  

## Compatibility

I downloaded a whole bunch of GPTQ models to test compatibility. [Here](model_compatibility.md) is the list of models
confirmed to be working right now.

## Recent updates

**2023-05-17**: Tested 32g models (30B weights take up a bit too much space still to work on 24 GB of VRAM with full
context.) Added error handling to C++/CUDA parts. Cleaned up and simplified the CUDA code a lot, preparing for fused
layers.

**2023-05-18**: Added basic layer streaming. Experimental for now. Modern GPUs should be designed for concurrent data
transfer and execution, and there should be enough bandwidth to stream in every *n*th layer while the preceding *n*-1
layers are processing. It's still too slow to be useful for generation, though. Also doesn't work with multiple GPUs.

**2023-05-19**: Wrote a CUDA implementation of the layer norm. Turns out it was a bit of a bottleneck for the smaller
models. Noticeably faster now.

**2023-05-21**: Added beam search implementation. It doesn't process beams in parallel which saves a lot of VRAM but
does slow it down a bit. There should be ways to mitigate the slowdown. It's not clear how much better beam search
performs in practice, but it's at least theoretically superior and there are other features coming which will build
on it, like multi-token repetition penalties and (de-)censoring.

**2023-05-22**: Added option to auto-split layers across multiple GPUs based on VRAM allocation. 

**2023-05-22**: Added option to dequantize layers at load-time which _should_ speed up inference, but it turns out
Torch's fp16 matmul is actually slower than the quantized matmul. Maybe bandwidth is the only bottleneck right now?
Need to experiment some more.

**2023-05-24**: Downloaded a bunch of models from HF and set up a test script. Should be a good sampling of the most
popular finetunes right now. I'll add more to the list as I come across them. They all seem to be working.

**2023-05-24**: Added fused rotary embeddings and some minor optimizations. 13% faster on 7B, 9% on 13B. Small
improvement on larger models. Added best-case scores to benchmark results and some clarification. For easier
comparisons to other implementations, or whatever.
